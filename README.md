Welcome to the **Dynamic Pricing Engine for Event Ticketing** project! 
This repository contains a complete, end-to-end prototype designed to optimize pricing...

Key Features

Live Data Fetching: Grabs data from APIs—both internal (ticket sales) and external (weather, artist buzz).

SQL Integration: Stores everything in an SQLite database for easy querying and scaling later.

Machine Learning: Uses scikit learn to train a regression model that suggests optimal prices based on historical sales and conditions.
Excel Reporting: Exports clean, readable reports with pricing suggestions and revenue estimates.
Modular Design: Each part (data ingestion, model, reporting) is standalone and reusable.

Future Enhancements

✅ REST API via Flask/FastAPI

✅ UI Dashboard with live updates

✅ Logging & exception handling

✅ Advanced ML algorithms (Random Forest, XGBoost)

✅ Sentiment analysis from social media






Made with ❤️ for learning, analytics, and ticket pricing innovation.
